# Sign-Language-Recognition
This project implements a gesture recognition system using OpenCV and a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The system processes over 30,000 images to efficiently detect and interpret various signs and gestures.

Achieved an accuracy of 85% in recognizing signs.
Utilizes image processing techniques and machine learning models for reliable gesture detection.
